merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b a m b n m n and p p m parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2log2 2m13m p m plog2 n m steps if n 2bm b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2log2 m1 m p2b steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude i e n km with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2log2 m1 m p3k steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batcher s algorithm which requires n p m n 2plog2 m steps in the general case and km p k1 2m plog2 m in the special case where n km cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am
