Throughout the Fall of 2016, the authors were exposed to various core Information Retrieval concepts. In this project, an attempt has been made to put the concepts into practice by building, evaluating and comparing different search engines.

The goal of this project is to build IR systems, make variations to improve the baseline runs, and compare their performance levels in terms of retrieval effectiveness.

The project is mainly coded in Python and Java. Excel has been used for analysis and data visualization. Libraries that are used include BeutifulSoup, jSoup, and Lucene. PyCharms and IntelliJ by JetBrains are the IDEs that were used to aid in coding. Github has been used for version control.

This work on this project has been planned and executed by Shail Shah, Drashti Bhuta and Eswara Sai Surya Teja Gummalla. All of them actively studied various resources to implement IR systems.
